            <h2>Experiences</h2>
            <p>My first experience is my student job at the Crêperie du Moulin de Chaugenet in Saint-Étienne de Montluc, where I have been working for almost 4 years as a versatile waiter. It has been very enriching; I have learned a lot of things and developed many skills there.</p>
            <p>My second notable experience was an internship at Golden Circle Suites (two months in 2023), a luxury hospitality company in Finnish Lapland, was an incredible experience. I was involved in various tasks, from customer management to organizing safaris. I learned to manage online bookings, prepare activities for groups, and solve logistical problems. Working in a multicultural environment allowed me to improve my language and interpersonal skills. This experience provided me with an in-depth understanding of the hospitality and tourism sector, enhancing my professional abilities and self-confidence.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Sports team coaching: I have always been involved in sports clubs, tennis and basketball, both in the organization of matches and in the management of my own team or those of the youngest. I have been practicing Street Workout in an association for 5 years. Travelling abroad to discover different cultures. I really enjoy outdoor activities and work.</p>
            <p>I learned a lot in this association and through this lesser-known sport.</p>
